# Simple Shooter Game

This project was completing during my programming 2 class (COP 3003). My project is a third person shooter that takes place in a futuristic time. I made this independently with help from an online course that I was taking on UDEMY.com (https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/). I made this project during the first semester of my junior year. I would still consider myself a beginner with unread engine and have lots of room to improve upon my skills. I made this project because I have a love for videogames and I have been interested in developing one myself for some time and I thought why not do it now that I have a school project that would allow me to. I found this project to be a fun experience and quite possibly one I expand upon in the future. I made this project at home where I could use my stronger PC rather than my laptop. 





I will be creating a video game

- In this project I will be creating a Third Person Shooter
- In this game the goal will be to defeat the enemies

The  Answer to the question:

Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype).
Is in the file SimpleShooterGameGameBase.cpp

All the files that I downloaded and that are created at run time are included in this link in my OneDrive:

Here is a link to the whole file to my game in order to allow it to be made on another device:
