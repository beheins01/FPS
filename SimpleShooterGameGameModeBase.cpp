//Inheritance: There is a reuse of a function. A program having two functions such as x and y and we can say x is inherited from y if y has some function of x written in it.
//Subtype: It refers to the compatibility of the interface.In this, q is a subtype of p if every function that is used for invoking q can be used for invoking p as well.
//Inheritance functions will always have subtyping.
//But subtyping will not always have inheritance.
