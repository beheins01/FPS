\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file sets up the AI\textquotesingle{}s that are in my game. 

Within this file I set up the the ability to give my AI behavior and also set up two vectors \char`\"{}\+Player\+Location, Start\+Location.\char`\"{} I also set up the ability for the code to see if the AI has died, so that they cannot shoot you when they are dead.
